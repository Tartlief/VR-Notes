## Week #8: Prototyping

### What is a Prototype?

"People cannot describe what they want, but they are quick to recognise what they do not like."

- Rapid approximation of a design idea used to gather feedback.
- A limited representation of a product design
- Meant to let us feel and/or visualize what the product is.

- NOT a finished product.
- Part of System Design.

#### Benefits
- Afforded lots of flexibility to make radical design changes.
- No coding / scripting required.
- Cheap
- Provide valuable feedback.

1. Get feedback earlier with low-cost
2. Chance experiment with alternatives.
3. Easier to change or throw away.

#### Activities of Prototyping
- Interactive exploration with envisioned product.
- Clarifies vague requirements and promotes vision-clarity with stakeholders.
- Answers questions and supports design descision with forced reflection.
- Tests feasibility and compatibility.
- Help to sell product idea.
- Inspires innovation.

#### Purpose of a Prototype
- Provide FEEL: What might it look like?
- Provide IMPLEMENTATION: What might it work like?
- Provide ROLE: What might the experience be like?

#### RIGHTS of a prototype
1. Does not need to be complete.
2. Should be easy to change / iterate upon.
