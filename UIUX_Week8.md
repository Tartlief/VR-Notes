# UIUX Notes

## Week #8: Prototyping

### What is a Prototype?

"People cannot describe what they want, but they are quick to recognise what they do not like."

- Rapid approximation of a design idea used to gather feedback.
- A limited representation of a product design
- Meant to let us feel and/or visualize what the product is.

- NOT a finished product.
- Part of System Design.

#### Benefits
- Afforded lots of flexibility to make radical design changes.
- No coding / scripting required.
- Cheap
- Provide valuable feedback.

1. Get feedback earlier with low-cost
2. Chance experiment with alternatives.
3. Easier to change or throw away.

#### Activities of Prototyping
- Interactive exploration with envisioned product.
- Clarifies vague requirements and promotes vision-clarity with stakeholders.
- Answers questions and supports design descision with forced reflection.
- Tests feasibility and compatibility.
- Help to sell product idea.
- Inspires innovation.

#### Purpose of a Prototype
- Provide FEEL: What might it look like?
- Provide IMPLEMENTATION: What might it work like?
- Provide ROLE: What might the experience be like?

#### RIGHTS of a prototype
1. Does not need to be complete.
2. Should be easy to change / iterate upon.

### Storyboards
- Pen and Paper simulation or walkthrough of system look and functionality.

Comprises of:
- Sequence of diagrams or drawings.
- Series of scene sketches showing user progression through a task flow or use case.
- Conveys key snapshots.
- Often used with scenarios to bring detail.

Storyboards are a means of communicating IDEAS.
- Can appear as drawings which showcases an envisioned scenario of how the user may use it.

#### Benefits of Storyboarding
- Holistic Focus
- Avoids commitment to a particular user interface (no buttons yet)
- Helps get all the stakeholders on the same page in terms of the goal.
- Gather early feedback.

#### Convey
What should storyboards aim to convey?
- Setting
    - People involved
    - Environment
    - Task being accomplished
- Sequence
    - Steps involved
    - Someone's purpose of using the app?
    - What task is being illustrated?
- Satisfaction
    - What motivates people to use this system?
    - What does it enable people to accomplish?
    - What need does the system fill?

#### Multi-Dimensional Fidelity
- Breadth: % of features covered.
    - Only enough key features for certain tasks.
    - Limit / Omit QoL features.
- Depth: degree of functionality.
    - Canned responses, no error handling, without much robustness

### Prototype Fidelity

#### Low-Fidelity
- Low-cost, short-duration to produce
- Does not realistically simulate the final product.
- Uses medium (ie. Paper, cardboard) to be illustrated.
- Important early on to encourage creative flexibility and exploration of ideas during conceptual design.

#### High-Fidelity
- Increased similarity of final product.
- May even be using components

### Types of Prototypes

#### Paper
- Interactive paper mock-up (Similar to what you did for Assignment #3)
- Natural Interaction (Pointing with Finger)
- User / Tester simulate computer or digital operation.
- Low-Fidelity in look and feel.

##### Benefits
- Faster to build
- Easier to change
- Focuses attention on big picture.
- Non-programmers can contribute.

#### Video
- Video illustration of how users will interact with a new system.
- Often used to quickly represent design concepts that involve complex relationships.
- Video may illustrate:
    - Motivation
    - Successes
- Videos may capture:
    - Shots and narrative
    - Draw on tasks observed during need-finding
    - Illistrate important tasks the system enables.
    - Can help scope a minimum-viable product.

##### Benefits
- Great communication tools
- Ties interface designs to tasks
- May serve as a specification for developers
- Fast? and low-cost?

#### Computer
- Interactive simulation
- High-Fidelity in look and feel.
- Low-Fidelity in depth.
    - Covers most features, but no backend.
    - Akin to Horizontal prototype.

- Computer Prototype should be considered as a 2nd stage to Paper Prototype as:
    - It inherits all benefits of paper prototype and:
    - Hi-Fi screen layout for accurate user evaluation
    - Hi-Fi colors, fonts, and other elements
    - Provides interactive feedback.
    - Enables ability to evaluate efficiency issues on the digital applications.

##### Benefits
- Faster than coding
- No debugging
- Easier to change or throw away

##### Problems
- Can confuse boundary between prototype and final product
- Can unintentionally set high expectations on the final product
- Software may suffer from slow-performance.
- Requires some programming / coding skills.

#### Wizard of Oz
- Using a real person to pretend to be the product.
- User thinks they are interacting with a computer, but a human is responding to the output.

##### Benefits
- Realistic
- Identifies bugs and problems with current design
- User is at the center of development
- Can envision challenging-to-build applications
- Designer and developers learn by playing wizard.

##### Problems
- May misrepresent capabilities of existing middle-ware
- Wizards require training and can be inconsistent during tests.
- Can be exhausting to be the wizard.
- Some features are impossible to mimic.
- May be inconvenient.
