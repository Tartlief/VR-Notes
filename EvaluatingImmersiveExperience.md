Notes for VR Quiz 2 based on Revision Lecture

## Evaluating Immersive Experiences

### Descriptions of Immersion
- Wide FOV
- Higher Spatial Presence
- Higher place illusion
- 8K Resolution Display
- Lower Cybersickness
- 6-DOF inside-out tracking: 6 Degrees of Freedom inside-out tracking is VR system that tracks the position and orientation of VR headsets and controllers without the need for external sensors or markers.
    - Remember how the Quest 2 seemed to know where the controllers were in "3D Space"
    - Similar to physically picking stuff off the ground in the virtual space, the camera lowers itself when your VR headset is physically lowered.

### Immersion From Systems Perspective:
- Wide FOV
- 8K Resolution Display
- 6 DOF Inside-out tracking

## Immersion from an Experiential Perspective:
- Higher Spatial Presence
- Higher place illusion
- Lower Cybersickness

## Surveys and Questionnaires used for VR User Experience Evaluation
### Systems Usability Scale (SUS)

### Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)
- Question will help researchers and developers to identify potential sources of discomfort or motion sickness.
- Questions here accesses simulator sickness.
- Covered symptoms include: Nausea, Dizziness, Headache, and Eyestrain.
- Users will rate symptoms from 'None' to 'Severe'
### Flow State Scale (FSS)
- This measures an individual's experience of flow, the ability to enter a psychological state characterized by complete immersion.
- The term "in the zone" can be used.

- This questionnaire covers the following:
    1. Concentration: How focused in the activity?
    2. Challenge-Skill Balance: Is the activity sufficiently challenging?
    3. Clear Goals
    4. Loss of Self-Consciousness: Does the individual lose the sense of self-awareness and time when interacting in the simulation.
    5. Control: How much control do they have within the simulation.
    6. Merging of Action and Awareness
    7. Autotelic Experience: Do they find the activity intrinsically rewarding and enjoyable.

### Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ)
- This focuses on measuring the sense of presence being experienced by individuals in a virtual environment.
- Do they get the sense that they are being there, as if it was immersive and engaging.

- The questionnaire covers the following:
    1. Spatial Presence: The feeling of being physically located within the virtual environment.
    2. Involvement: The extent to which the individual feels mentally engaged and absorbed in the virtual experience.
    3. Realism: Perception of the realism and believability of the virtual environment.
    4. Immersion: The sense of being enveloped or immersed in the virtual world.
    5. Sensory Fidelity: The quality and fidelity of sensory experiences (e.g., visual, auditory) within the virtual environment.
    6. Interface Quality: Evaluation of the user interface and interaction design within the virtual environment.
    7. Negative Effects: Assessment of any negative effects experienced during or after the virtual experience, such as discomfort or disorientation.

- The IPQ is widely used in VR research and development to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual environments, identify factors that enhance or detract from presence, and inform the design of immersive VR experiences. It helps researchers understand how to create more compelling and engaging virtual environments that maximize the sense of presence for users.
### Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire (VRSQ)
- The Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire (VRSQ) is a standardized tool used to assess symptoms of discomfort or sickness experienced by individuals when using virtual reality (VR) systems. VR sickness, also known as simulator sickness or cybersickness, is a phenomenon similar to motion sickness that can occur when the sensory inputs from the virtual environment conflict with the brain's expectations or perceptions of motion.

- The VRSQ typically consists of a series of questions designed to assess various symptoms associated with VR sickness, such as:

    1. Nausea: Feelings of queasiness or stomach discomfort.
    2. Oculomotor Symptoms: Eye strain, headaches, or difficulty focusing.
    3. Disorientation: Feeling dizzy, lightheaded, or off-balance.
    4. General Comfort: Overall comfort level during or after the VR experience.
    5. Eyestrain: Sensations of discomfort or strain in the eyes.
    6. Difficulty Focusing: Problems with maintaining focus or visual clarity.
    7. Sweating: Excessive sweating or feeling overheated.

    Participants typically rate the severity of each symptom they experienced during or after the VR experience on a scale, often ranging from "none" to "severe."

- The VRSQ helps researchers, developers, and clinicians evaluate the potential side effects of VR systems, identify factors that contribute to VR sickness, and make adjustments to minimize discomfort for users. It also aids in understanding individual differences in susceptibility to VR sickness and can inform the design of VR experiences to reduce adverse effects and improve user comfort and satisfaction.


## Design Affordances in VR

1. Hand-tracking that allows natural manipulation of objects
2. Having objects with clear grooves for gripping
3. Haptic feedback when an object correctly fits into place.
4. Highlighting interactive objects with subtle glow effects.
5. Optimizing the frame rate and reducing latency
6. Having increasing difficulty levels in the puzzles.
