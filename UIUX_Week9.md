# UIUX Notes

## Week #9: Visual Design

### Goals and Principles of Visual Design
- Modern design implies a rational, functional, information-oriented perspective.
- Design implies a balance between functional (technical) and aesthetic goals.
- "A clear visual organization is essential for effective communication."

#### Goal of Visual Design
- Guide
- Pace
- Message

#### Principles
- Simplicity
    - Simpler the better
    - Usable, immediate, approachable, Recognizable
    - Can be achieved by: Reducing, Regularizing, Combining

##### Reduction
- Determine the essential elements
- Examine each element, then ask if its needed.
- Try to remove if not imported.
- Even if it is, try to remove it, to see if the design remains coherent without it.

##### Regularization
- Repeat elements according to a discernible rule principle or "rhythm".
- Limit inessential variation.
- Use regular geometric forms and muted colors wherever possible.
- Make them as close to identical as possible.
- Limit variation in font size, type.
- Elements that are to stand out should not be regularized.

##### Combination
- Review the role played by each element.
- Combine multiple components which are doing the same thing.
- Combine redundant elements into a single, simpler unit.

- Contrast
    - Achieved by differentiation: Distinguish relevant forms from background.
    - Emphasis: On the aspects of presentation.

- White Space
    - Conveys grouping an relationship.
    - Leads the eyes
    - Ease of reading.

##### Gestalt Principles of Grouping:
1. Proximity
2. Similarity
3. Continuity
4. Closure
5. Area
6. Symmetry

- Balance
    - Choose an axis
    - Make sure visual weights of elements on each side are approximately equal.
    - Symmetry is aesthically pleasing.
    - Assymetry are harder to balance, but can increase tension and activity. (ie. GAM Player UI)

##### Types of Balance
- Symmetrical Balance
- Radial Balance

- Alignment
    - Either left or right-justify your labels.
    - Try to align your controls on the left and the right.
    - Align controls and labels on the same baseline.

##### Vertical Alignment
- Center, top or bottom of elements align on an invisible horizontal line.
##### Horizontal Alignment
- Center, left / right side of elements align on an invisible vertical line.
##### Center Alignment
- Centered vertical alignment
- Centered horizontal alignment
##### Left and Right Horizontal Alignment
- Establish a max-width for all content, to ensure an invisible box will ensure elements are aligned whether they are pushed to the left or the right side.

### Typography
- Display text on the screen
    - Key decisions: font and spacing
- Font Design Elements
    - X-height
    - Ascender/Descenders
    - Point
    - Leading
    - Serifs
    - Kerning

- Spacing Guidelines
    - Always use whitespace
    - Use generous leading
    - Keep text paragraphs narrow

- Typeface
    - Refers to a family of fonts that share the same name.
- Font Selection

#### Design Considerations
    - Eye Tracking
    - Easy Scanning
    - Above the Fold

### Grid Layout
- Grids
        - Help with the placement and alignment of all visual objects
        - Help to scan and understand a page quickly.
        - Helps to guide the eyes and reduce clutter.

#### Rule of Thirds
- Theory that dictates how an image should be composed in order to create an aesthetically pleasing result.

### Color Theory
- Practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of specific color combinations
- Avoid simultaneous display of highly saturated, spectrally extreme colors.
    - use pastel colors
    - Unless to draw attention to something.
- Be consistent with conventions and expectations.
    - Red means stop/bad/error/attention
    - Green means go.
- Use fewer colors
    - To prevent complex, clutter.
