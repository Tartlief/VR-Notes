# UIUX Notes

## Week #9: Visual Design

### Goals and Principles of Visual Design
- Modern design implies a rational, functional, information-oriented perspective.
- Design implies a balance between functional (technical) and aesthetic goals.
- "A clear visual organization is essential for effective communication."

#### Goal of Visual Design
- Guide
- Pace
- Message

#### Principles
- Simplicity
    - Simpler the better
    - Usable, immediate, approachable, Recognizable
    - Can be achieved by: Reducing, Regularizing, Combining

##### Reduction
- Determine the essential elements
- Examine each element, then ask if its needed.
- Try to remove if not imported.
- Even if it is, try to remove it, to see if the design remains coherent without it.

##### Regularization
- Repeat elements according to a discernible rule principle or "rhythm".
- Limit inessential variation.
- Use regular geometric forms and muted colors wherever possible.
- Make them as close to identical as possible.
- Limit variation in font size, type.
- Elements that are to stand out should not be regularized.

##### Combination
- Review the role played by each element.
- Combine multiple components which are doing the same thing.
- Combine redundant elements into a single, simpler unit.

- Contrast
    - Achieved by differentiation: Distinguish relevant forms from background.
    - Emphasis: On the aspects of presentation.

- White Space
    - Conveys grouping an relationship.
    - Leads the eyes
    - Ease of reading.

##### Gestalt Principles of Grouping:
1. Proximity
2. Similarity
3. Continuity
4. Closure
5. Area
6. Symmetry

- Balance
    - Choose an axis
    - Make sure visual weights of elements on each side are approximately equal.
    - Symmetry is aesthically pleasing.
    - Assymetry are harder to balance, but can increase tension and activity. (ie. GAM Player UI)

##### Types of Balance
- Symmetrical Balance
- Radial Balance

- Alignment
    - Either left or right-justify your labels.
    - Try to align your controls on the left and the right.
    - Align controls and labels on the same baseline.

##### Vertical Alignment
- Center, top or bottom of elements align on an invisible horizontal line.
##### Horizontal Alignment
- Center, left / right side of elements align on an invisible vertical line.
##### Center Alignment
- Centered vertical alignment
- Centered horizontal alignment
##### Left and Right Horizontal Alignment
- Establish a max-width for all content, to ensure an invisible box will ensure elements are aligned whether they are pushed to the left or the right side.

### Typography

### Grid Layout

### Color Theory
