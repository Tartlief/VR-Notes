Notes for VR Quiz 2 based on Revision Lecture

## Foundational Concepts of Immersion
- Goals include differentiating between AR, VR, XR, MR
- Understand and explain Milgram and Kishino's Reality-Virtuality Continuum.
- Describe the historical evolution of immersive technologies.

### Different types "Realities"
#### Alternate Reality AR
- Overlay of virtual digital information into the real world.
- 3D objects, images or videos may be overlayed into your world through lens which can alter one's perception of reality.
- Apple Vision, Pokemon GO are examples of AR, where 3D visuals may be seen, but cannot be physically interacted with.
#### Virtual Reality VR
- Fully-immersing the user into a virtual world.
- Computer-generated 3D environments that users can interact with.
- Modern iterations mainly include headsets or goggles.
- Quest 2, Valve Index are examples of VR Headsets that can cast digital content straight into the eyes of the user, immersing them and cutting their visual experience off from the real world.
#### Extended Reality XR
- This mainly involves experiences that involves the convergence of AR, VR, and MR technologies.
#### Mixed Reality MR
- Mixed reality involves blending virtual content with the physical environment, enabling interaction with the 2.
- It involves anchoring virtual objects to real-world surfaces to allow users to interact with them as if they were real.
- Microsoft HoloLens is an example of a device which enables MR interactions.
